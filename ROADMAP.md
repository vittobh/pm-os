## Vision

pm-os becomes the default PM operating layer for product teams and consulting engagements —
the system that connects every knowledge source, generates every artifact, and learns from every product.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Current)

**Goal:** Org Workspace live. PMs can onboard, connect tools, search KB, reuse artifacts.

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Master PRD (v0.4) | ✅ Done |
| SRS + FRD (v0.4) | ✅ Done |
| PM Onboarding UI (6-step wizard) | ✅ Done |
| GitHub Pages deployment | ✅ Done |
| Microsoft Teams tab + manifest | ✅ Done |
| CuCP 90-day rollout slide deck | ✅ Done |
| Atlassian Rovo KB search integration | 🔲 Next |
| Microsoft 365 Graph search integration | 🔲 Next |
| Google Workspace API search integration | 🔲 Next |

## Phase 2 — KB & Standard Reporting

**Goal:** Federated search live across all sources. Standard tier fully usable.

| Deliverable | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Unified search UI (Rovo + M365 + Google) | Q3 2026 |
| Artifact tagging: domain · stage · type · compliance | Q3 2026 |

## Phase 3 — AI Tier

**Goal:** Chat, artifact generation, and PowerBI AI interpretation live for AI-tier PMs.

## Phase 5 — Full Pipeline Integration

**Goal:** End-to-end: idea → discovery → PRD → code → deploy → KB archival.

| Deliverable | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Discovery Engine: problem statement → full research pack | Q2 2027 |
| Delivery Engine: PRD → backlog · KPI plan · Y-Score gate · rollout plan | Q2 2027 |

## Principles of Proportional Delivery

Borrowed from the Coupa CuCP framework — applied to pm-os itself:

- Each phase ships something usable before the next begins
- Standard tier always ships before AI tier (cost-safe, broader adoption)
- Client features ship only after internal org use is stable
- Mandate nothing — earn adoption through value at each phase
